        <h2>Domain Name</h2>
        <p>For the domain name I am going with mudlake.com. This is a great domain name because GoDaddy told me that 'lake' is a commonly used keyword and it is short and memorable. A name like this will really help my site go far. The only problem being it is on sale for $194,888.</p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p> the purpose for the Chamber of Commerce site is to promote business in Mud Lake. We want to encourage people to come and check out the beautiful town, as well as how business and see what a wonderful place this is to do business in. We want the site to serve as a hub for people to come and check out Mud lake, see what it is like. That way they will be more inclined to visit. This can include but is not limited to pictures, weather, events, attractions, and more!</p>
