            <h2>Whitespace</h2>
            <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/"><img src="images/nintendo.jpg"
                    alt="Screeenshot from Nintendo.com"></a>
            <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/">Nintendo.com</a>
            <p>This is a great example of whitespace use. Nintendo really uses whitespace to make
                the whole site have a relaxed feel. This makes me want to stay on the site longer
                since I don't feel claustrophobic while here. Notice expecially the white space in
                between the pictures you can select, around the image being displayed, and even
                between the paragraphs. The line height also reflects proper use of whitespace,
                making it easy to read. </p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en//"><img src="images/family-search.jpg"
                    alt="Screeenshot from Familysearch.org"></a>
            <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/">Familysearch.org</a>
            <p>In this example, family search.org uses contrast to great affectedness. Notice how
                the black contrasts highly against the call to action button. The get started button
                really pops with that bright blue against the black background, and that helps me to
                know that that is what they want me to click. It's especially important to have a
                high contrast with a call to action button, that way people really notice what it is
                that they need to do. </p>

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <a href="https://www.eatthismuch.com"><img src="images/eat-this-much.jpg"
                    alt="Screeenshot from Eatthismuch.com"></a>
            <a href="https://www.eatthismuch.com">Eatthismuch.com</a>
            <p>The realignment of the words on this page really pops! Or rather, it doesn't pop.
                That's because it helps your eyes flow down the page naturally, so you don't really
                notice that you have kept reading. The proper alignment in the center of the
                paragraphs on this page as well as the headings draw the eye downward, causing you
                to read more. </p>
